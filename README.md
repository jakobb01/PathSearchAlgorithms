## Visualization of most popular path searching algorithms on a simple matrix.

Simple interactive "maze" that showcases 4 different search algorithms:
- Breath first search
- Deapth first search
- A*
- Best first search (Greedy Breath first search)

To run the program, simply run interactive.py

*Disclaimer: all running code is in interactive.py file for the moment, with future plans to reorganize and expand this project.*
